## Getting Started
The best way to get familiar with this crate is through the `examples` (see [examples](https://github.com/jonah-h/tline/blob/main/examples)).

You can run examples with `cargo run --example example_name`.
You may want to add the `--release` flag to cargo commands for improved perfromance.
